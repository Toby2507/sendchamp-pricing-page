# **Frontend Implementation of the SendChamp Pricing page.**

## The challenge

- Setup a React app with Chakra-UI and RecoilJS
- Replicate our Pricing Page (sendchamp.com).
- Use the font from the website.
- The only state management to be used should be RecoilJS.

- [Live Site URL](https://sendchamp-pricing-page.netlify.app/)

## How To Use

It's basically a clone of the pricing page of sendchamp.com

## My process

- Setup my react project with create-react-app and in this case the chakraUI template was used
- Break the UI design down into components and work from there
- Code the components and pages while making them respoonsive simulataneously
- Finally, test the app on different browsers and devices
- Deploy the app to Netlify

### Built with

- React
- Typescript
- ChakraUI
- Recoil.js for state management
- Mobile-first workflow

### Challenges

- This is an awesome learning avenue for me since I have never used a UI framework before, but thankfully I was able to pick it up very fast

- The main issue I had was navigating ChakraUI's documentation in such a short amount of time.
